# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
The Dataset consists 22 Columns in which 21 columns are independent and 1 column is dependent.

Predicting mobile price range using supervised Machine learning classification technique. The dataset tells that it is mutiple classification in nature.
I used some of the ML models which is very helpful to predict classification algorithm ex. KNN, SVM, and GuassianNB. 

Conclusion

By using all this algortihm my model is working good with KNN and SVM which are giving Accuracy somewhere around 95%.
