Ram - Random Access Memory in Mega Bytes
Sc_h - Screen Height of mobile in cm
Sc_w - Screen Width of mobile in cm
Talk_time - longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are
Three_g - Has 3G or not
Touch_screen - Has touch screen or not
Wifi - Has wifi or not
Price_range - This is the target variable with value of 0(low cost), 1(medium cost), 2(high cost) and 3(very high cost).


Predicting mobile price range using supervised Machine learning classification technique. The dataset tells that it is mutiple classification in nature.
I used some of the ML models which is very helpful to predict classification algorithm ex. KNN, SVM, and GuassianNB. By using all this algortihm my model is working good with KNN and SVM which are giving Accuracy somewhere around 95%.
